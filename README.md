# Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that allows a client to use abstract classes instead of concrete classes to create families of objects. It is useful in the following cases

- When you want the system to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- When you need to enforce a set of objects to be used together for better functioning.
- When you need to isolate or abstract the concrete classes by revealing only the interfaces and not their implementations
Determine the abstract products during the initial phase of designing based on which the abstract factory would be built.
